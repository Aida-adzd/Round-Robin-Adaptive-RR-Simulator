## Normal Round Robin Results

### Quantum = 2

- **Average Waiting Time:** 27.00
- **Average Turnaround Time:** 38.50
- Processes experience frequent context switching, which may lead to increased overhead.

### Quantum = 3

- **Average Waiting Time:** 28.00
- **Average Turnaround Time:** 39.50
- A slightly larger quantum reduces context switching but increases waiting time for longer processes.

### Quantum = 4

- **Average Waiting Time:** 26.50
- **Average Turnaround Time:** 38.00
- This quantum appears to strike a balance between context switching and fairness.

### Quantum = 5

- **Average Waiting Time:** 27.75
- **Average Turnaround Time:** 39.25
- Longer quantum reduces context switching but may result in smaller processes waiting longer.

## Adaptive Round Robin Results

- **Average Waiting Time:** 27.50
- **Average Turnaround Time:** 39.00
- The quantum dynamically adjusts to process characteristics, reducing delays for smaller tasks while preventing excessive overhead.
- The adaptability helps balance fairness and efficiency across different workloads.

## Comparison of Normal and Adaptive Round Robin

- In the adaptive approach, the average waiting time is nearly equal to the best value in the standard method (26.50 at Q=4 and 27.50 in adaptive).
- The turnaround time in the adaptive method is slightly higher than the best value in the standard method.
- In the adaptive method, the quantum changes dynamically based on process performance, reducing the likelihood of excessive delays for some processes.
- The adaptive approach is more flexible and may perform better in dynamic scenarios.
- Unlike fixed quantum values, the adaptive approach can optimize execution time based on system load.
- Processes with shorter burst times benefit from reduced waiting periods, while longer processes receive sufficient execution time without excessive interruptions.

## Conclusion
  
In this example, the **Adaptive Round Robin** method performed similarly or slightly better than the best standard **Round Robin (with Quantum = 4)**.

- The ability to dynamically adjust quantum size makes adaptive Round Robin a more efficient choice in scenarios with varied process execution times.
- Fixed quantum sizes may work well for predictable workloads, but adaptive scheduling enhances performance under diverse workloads.
- For real-world applications where process execution times are not uniform, the adaptive approach provides a better balance between fairness and efficiency.
